        :param str authorization: Access token (in JWT format) required to use any API endpoint (except `/oauth2`)
        :param str x_request_id: Supplied by client during request or generated by server.
        :param str continuation_token: An opaque token used to iterate over a collection. The token to use on the next request is returned in the `continuation_token` field of the result. Single quotes are required around all strings.
        :param str filter: Exclude resources that don't match the specified criteria. Single quotes are required around all strings inside the filters.
        :param list[str] ids: A comma-separated list of resource IDs. If there is not at least one resource that matches each `id` element, an error is returned. Single quotes are required around all strings.
        :param int limit: Limit the size of the response to the specified number of resources. A limit of 0 can be used to get the number of resources without getting all of the resources. It will be returned in the total_item_count field. If a client asks for a page size larger than the maximum number, the request is still valid. In that case the server just returns the maximum number of items, disregarding the client's page size request. If not specified, defaults to 1000.
        :param list[str] member_ids: A list of member IDs. Member IDs separated by a `+` indicate that both members must be present in each element. Member IDs separated by a `,` indicate that at least one member must be present in each element. If there is not at least one resource that matches each `member_id` element, an error is returned. Single quotes are required around all strings. When using Try it Out in Swagger, a list of member IDs separated by a `+` must be entered in the same item cell.
        :param list[str] member_names: A list of member names. Member names separated by a `+` indicate that both members must be present in each element. Member names separated by a `,` indicate that at least one member must be present in each element. If there is not at least one resource that matches each `member_name` element, an error is returned. Single quotes are required around all strings. When using Try it Out in Swagger, a list of member names separated by a `+` must be entered in the same item cell.
        :param int offset: The offset of the first resource to return from a collection.
        :param list[str] sort: Sort the response by the specified fields (in descending order if '-' is appended to the field name). If you provide a sort you will not get a continuation token in the response.
        :param list[str] source_ids: A list of source IDs. Source IDs separated by a `+` indicate that both sources must be present in each element. Source IDs separated by a `,` indicate that at least one source must be present in each element. If there is not at least one resource that matches each `source_id` element, an error is returned. Single quotes are required around all strings. When using Try it Out in Swagger, a list of source IDs separated by a `+` must be entered in the same item cell.
        :param list[str] source_names: A list of source names. Source names separated by a `+` indicate that both sources must be present in each element. Source names separated by a `,` indicate that at least one source must be present in each element. If there is not at least one resource that matches each `source_name` element, an error is returned. Single quotes are required around all strings. When using Try it Out in Swagger, a list of source names separated by a `+` must be entered in the same item cell.
        :param list[str] target_ids: A list of target IDs. Target IDs separated by a `+` indicate that both targets must be present in each element. Target IDs separated by a `,` indicate that at least one target must be present in each element. If there is not at least one resource that matches each `target_id` element, an error is returned. Single quotes are required around all strings. When using Try it Out in Swagger, a list of target IDs separated by a `+` must be entered in the same item cell.
        :param list[str] target_names: A list of target names. Target names separated by a `+` indicate that both targets must be present in each element. Target names separated by a `,` indicate that at least one target must be present in each element. If there is not at least one resource that matches each `target_name` element, an error is returned. Single quotes are required around all strings. When using Try it Out in Swagger, a list of target names separated by a `+` must be entered in the same item cell.
        :param bool async_req: Request runs in separate thread and method returns multiprocessing.pool.ApplyResult.
        :param bool _return_http_data_only: Returns only data field.
        :param bool _preload_content: Response is converted into objects.
        :param int _request_timeout: Total request timeout in seconds.
