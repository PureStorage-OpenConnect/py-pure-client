If the server does not support the requested flavor, the mount operation fails. If `sys`, trusts the client to specify user's identity. If `krb5`, provides cryptographic proof of a user's identity in each RPC request. This provides  strong verification of the identity of users accessing data on the server. Note that additional configuration besides adding this mount option is required in order to enable Kerberos security. If `krb5i`, adds integrity checking to krb5, to ensure the data has not been tampered with. If `krb5p`, adds integrity checking and encryption to krb5. This is the most secure setting, but it also involves the most performance overhead. The default is `sys` if not specified.")
