            client_id (str, optional):
                ID of API client that issued the identity token.
            key_id (str, optional):
                Key ID of API client that issued the identity token.

        :param limit: Limits the size of the response to the specified number of objects on each page.
                    To return the total number of resources, set `limit=0`. The total number of
                    resources is returned as a `total_item_count` value. If the page size
                    requested is larger than the system maximum limit, the server returns the
                    maximum limit, disregarding the requested page size.

                    in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending
                    order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To
                    sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single
                    request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all
                    volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the
                    same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list

                                response. A query has reached its last page when the response does not
                                include a token. Pagination requires the `limit` and `continuation_token`
                                query parameters.
        :type continuation_token: str
        :param destroyed: If set to `true`, lists only destroyed objects that are in the eradication
                        pending state. If set to `false`, lists only objects that are not destroyed.
                        For destroyed objects, the time remaining is displayed in milliseconds.
        :type destroyed: bool

                    criteria.

        :param ids: Performs the operation on the unique resource IDs specified. Enter multiple
                    resource IDs in comma-separated format. The `ids` or `names` parameter is
                    required, but they cannot be set together.
        :type ids: List[str]
        :param limit: Limits the size of the response to the specified number of objects on each page.
                    To return the total number of resources, set `limit=0`. The total number of
                    resources is returned as a `total_item_count` value. If the page size
                    requested is larger than the system maximum limit, the server returns the
                    maximum limit, disregarding the requested page size.
        :type limit: int
        :param names: Performs the operation on the unique name specified. Enter multiple names in
                    comma-separated format. For example, `name01,name02`.
        :type names: List[str]
        :param offset: The starting position based on the results of the query in relation to the full
                    set of response objects returned.
        :type offset: int
        :param sort: Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `sort` to the name in
                    the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names
                    in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending
                    order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To
                    sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single
                    request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all
                    volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the
                    same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list
                    the names as comma-separated values.
        :type sort: List[str]
        :param source_ids: Performs the operation on the source ID specified. Enter multiple source IDs in
                        comma-separated format.
        :type source_ids: List[str]
        :param source_names: Performs the operation on the source name specified. Enter multiple source names
                            in comma-separated format. For example, `name01,name02`.
        :type source_names: List[str]
        :param total_item_count: If set to `true`, the `total_item_count` matching the specified query parameters
                                is calculated and returned in the response. If set to `false`, the
                                `total_item_count` is `null` in the response. This may speed up queries
                                where the `total_item_count` is large. If not specified, defaults to
                                `false`.
        :type total_item_count: bool
        :param total_only: If set to `true`, returns the aggregate value of all items after filtering.
                        Where it makes more sense, the average value is displayed instead. The
                        values are displayed for each name where meaningful. If `total_only=true`,
                        the `items` list will be empty.

A status of `replicating` indicates that the source array is replicating to the target array. A status of `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being sent.

A status of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target pod.

A status of `replicating` indicates that the source array is replicating to the target array. A status of `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being sent. During this phase, you cannot promote the target pod. In addition, changing the link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target pod.

        :param resolution: The number of milliseconds between samples of historical data. For array-wide
                        performance metrics (`/arrays/performance` endpoint), valid values are
                        `1000` (1 second), `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30

                        hours). For performance metrics on storage objects (`<object
                        name>/performance` endpoint), such as volumes, valid values are `30000` (30
                        seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours),
                        `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For space metrics,
                        (`<object name>/space` endpoint), valid values are `300000` (5 minutes),
                        `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and
                        `86400000` (24 hours). Include the `start_time` parameter to display the
                        performance data starting at the specified start time. If `start_time` is
                        not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end
                        time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be
                        displayed. Include the `end_time` parameter to display the performance data
                        until the specified end time. If `end_time`is not specified, the end time
                        will default to the current time. If the `resolution` parameter is not
                        specified but either the `start_time` or `end_time` parameter is, then
                        `resolution` will default to the lowest valid resolution.
        :type resolution: int
        :param sort: Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `sort` to the name in
                    the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names
                    in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending
                    order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To
                    sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single
                    request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all
                    volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the
                    same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list
                    the names as comma-separated values.
        :type sort: List[str]
        :param start_time: Displays historical performance data for the specified time window, where
                        `start_time` is the beginning of the time window, and `end_time` is the end
                        of the time window. The `start_time` and `end_time` parameters are specified
                        in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch. If `start_time` is not specified, the
                        start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that
                        the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. If
                        `end_time`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time.
                        Include the `resolution` parameter to display the performance data at the
                        specified resolution. If not specified, `resolution` defaults to the lowest
                        valid resolution.
        :type start_time: int
        :param total_item_count: If set to `true`, the `total_item_count` matching the specified query parameters
                                is calculated and returned in the response. If set to `false`, the
                                `total_item_count` is `null` in the response. This may speed up queries
                                where the `total_item_count` is large. If not specified, defaults to
                                `false`.
        :type total_item_count: bool
        :param total_only: If set to `true`, returns the aggregate value of all items after filtering.
                        Where it makes more sense, the average value is displayed instead. The
                        values are displayed for each name where meaningful. If `total_only=true`,
                        the `items` list will be empty.

Valid values are `replicating`, `baselining`, `paused`, `unhealthy`, `quiescing`, and `quiesced`. A status of `replicating` indicates that the source array is replicating to the target array. A status of `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being sent. During this phase, you cannot promote the target pod. In addition, changing the link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target pod.

        :param resolution: The number of milliseconds between samples of historical data. For array-wide
                        performance metrics (`/arrays/performance` endpoint), valid values are
                        `1000` (1 second), `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30

                        hours). For performance metrics on storage objects (`<object
                        name>/performance` endpoint), such as volumes, valid values are `30000` (30
                        seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours),
                        `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For space metrics,
                        (`<object name>/space` endpoint), valid values are `300000` (5 minutes),

                        `86400000` (24 hours). Include the `start_time` parameter to display the
                        performance data starting at the specified start time. If `start_time` is
                        not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end
                        time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be
                        displayed. Include the `end_time` parameter to display the performance data
                        until the specified end time. If `end_time`is not specified, the end time
                        will default to the current time. If the `resolution` parameter is not
                        specified but either the `start_time` or `end_time` parameter is, then
                        `resolution` will default to the lowest valid resolution.

                    order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To
                    sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single
                    request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all
                    volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the
                    same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list

                        in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch. If `start_time` is not specified, the

        :param limit: Limits the size of the response to the specified number of objects on each page.
                    To return the total number of resources, set `limit=0`. The total number of
                    resources is returned as a `total_item_count` value. If the page size
                    requested is larger than the system maximum limit, the server returns the

                    order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To

                    request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all
                    volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the
                    same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list

                    order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To

                    request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all
                    volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the
                    same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list

                    request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all
                    volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the
                    same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list

        :param destroyed: If set to `true`, lists only destroyed objects that are in the eradication
                        pending state. If set to `false`, lists only objects that are not destroyed.
                        For destroyed objects, the time remaining is displayed in milliseconds.
        :type destroyed: bool
        :param end_time: Displays historical performance data for the specified time window, where
                        `start_time` is the beginning of the time window, and `end_time` is the end
                        of the time window. The `start_time` and `end_time` parameters are specified
                        in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch. If `start_time` is not specified, the
                        start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that
                        the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. If
                        `end_time`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time.
                        Include the `resolution` parameter to display the performance data at the
                        specified resolution. If not specified, `resolution` defaults to the lowest
                        valid resolution.
        :type end_time: int
        :param filter: Narrows down the results to only the response objects that satisfy the filter
                    criteria.
        :type filter: str
        :param ids: Performs the operation on the unique resource IDs specified. Enter multiple
                    resource IDs in comma-separated format. The `ids` or `names` parameter is
                    required, but they cannot be set together.
        :type ids: List[str]
        :param limit: Limits the size of the response to the specified number of objects on each page.
                    To return the total number of resources, set `limit=0`. The total number of
                    resources is returned as a `total_item_count` value. If the page size
                    requested is larger than the system maximum limit, the server returns the
                    maximum limit, disregarding the requested page size.
        :type limit: int
        :param names: Performs the operation on the unique name specified. Enter multiple names in
                    comma-separated format. For example, `name01,name02`.
        :type names: List[str]
        :param offset: The starting position based on the results of the query in relation to the full
                    set of response objects returned.
        :type offset: int
        :param resolution: The number of milliseconds between samples of historical data. For array-wide
                        performance metrics (`/arrays/performance` endpoint), valid values are
                        `1000` (1 second), `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30
                        minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24
                        hours). For performance metrics on storage objects (`<object
                        name>/performance` endpoint), such as volumes, valid values are `30000` (30
                        seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours),
                        `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For space metrics,
                        (`<object name>/space` endpoint), valid values are `300000` (5 minutes),
                        `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and
                        `86400000` (24 hours). Include the `start_time` parameter to display the
                        performance data starting at the specified start time. If `start_time` is
                        not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end
                        time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be
                        displayed. Include the `end_time` parameter to display the performance data
                        until the specified end time. If `end_time`is not specified, the end time
                        will default to the current time. If the `resolution` parameter is not
                        specified but either the `start_time` or `end_time` parameter is, then
                        `resolution` will default to the lowest valid resolution.
        :type resolution: int
        :param sort: Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `sort` to the name in
                    the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names
                    in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending
                    order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To
                    sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single
                    request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all
                    volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the
                    same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list
                    the names as comma-separated values.
        :type sort: List[str]
        :param start_time: Displays historical performance data for the specified time window, where
                        `start_time` is the beginning of the time window, and `end_time` is the end
                        of the time window. The `start_time` and `end_time` parameters are specified
                        in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch. If `start_time` is not specified, the
                        start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that
                        the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. If
                        `end_time`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time.
                        Include the `resolution` parameter to display the performance data at the
                        specified resolution. If not specified, `resolution` defaults to the lowest
                        valid resolution.
        :type start_time: int
        :param total_item_count: If set to `true`, the `total_item_count` matching the specified query parameters
                                is calculated and returned in the response. If set to `false`, the
                                `total_item_count` is `null` in the response. This may speed up queries
                                where the `total_item_count` is large. If not specified, defaults to
                                `false`.
        :type total_item_count: bool
        :param total_only: If set to `true`, returns the aggregate value of all items after filtering.
                        Where it makes more sense, the average value is displayed instead. The
                        values are displayed for each name where meaningful. If `total_only=true`,
                        the `items` list will be empty.
