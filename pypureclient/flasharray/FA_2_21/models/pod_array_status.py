Valid values are `flummoxed`, `online`, `unknown`, and `unreachable`. Only mediators in the `online` status can mediate high availability events. If set to `flummoxed`, the array can reach a mediator, but it is talking to the wrong one. Verify that the DNS in the environment is properly configured. This status might also appear if the pod has been offline on one array for an extended period of time and the peer array is unreachable. If set to `online`, the array is successfully communicating with the mediator, and the mediator is available to mediate a high availability event. If set to `unreachable`, the array cannot reach the mediator, either due to network issues or because the mediator is down. When a mediator is unreachable, synchronous replication continues to function provided all arrays are healthy and communicating, but a high availability event without mediator access can result in an outage.")
    pre_elected: Optional[StrictBool] = Field(default=None, description="If set to `true`, the array has been pre-elected to remain online in the rare event that the mediator is inaccessible on both arrays within the stretched pod, and then later, the arrays within the stretched pod become disconnected from each other. If set to `false`, either the array has been pre-elected to remain offline while its peer array remains online, or pre-election is not in effect. One and only one array within each pod is pre-elected at a given point in time, so while a pre-elected array is keeping the pod online, the pod on its non-elected peer array remains offline during the communication failure. Users cannot pre-elect arrays.")

    status: Optional[StrictStr] = Field(default=None, description="The status of the array within the stretched pod. Valid values are `offline`, `online`, `resyncing`, `suspended`, and `unknown`. If set to `offline`, the array is experiencing problems and may not have the latest pod data. The array cannot handle I/O to the pod and cannot take over during a high availability event. If set to `online`, the array is online and has the latest pod data. The array can handle I/O to the pod and take over during a high availability event. If set to `suspended`, the array is experiencing a short connection glitch of the pod. This is a temporary status and would transition to either `online` or `offline` soon. `suspended` is a new status that is exposed, starting from version 6.6.0. If set to `resyncing`, the array is actively getting the latest pod data so that it becomes fully synchronized with its peer array. During the resyncing process, the array cannot handle I/O to the pod. Once the arrays are fully synchronized, the array changes to `online` status. If set to `unknown`, the status of the peer array is unknown because this array is offline and cannot determine the state of the pod on the peer array. Only the peer array can ever be in unknown status; this unknown status is unique to the local array and will differ when viewed from its peer array.")
