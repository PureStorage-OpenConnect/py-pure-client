        Deletes pod replica links. The `local_pod_names` and `remote_pod_names` are required. Valid values are `replicating`, `baselining`, `paused`, `unhealthy`, `quiescing`, and `quiesced`. A status of `replicating` indicates that the source array is replicating to the target array. A status of `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being sent. During this phase, you cannot promote the target pod. In addition, changing the link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target pod.

        Modifies pod replica links. The `local_pod_names` and `remote_pod_names` are required. Valid values are `replicating`, `baselining`, `paused`, `unhealthy`, `quiescing`, and `quiesced`. A status of `replicating` indicates that the source array is replicating to the target array. A status of `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being sent. During this phase, you cannot promote the target pod. In addition, changing the link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target pod.

If `end_time`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. Include the `resolution` parameter to display the performance data at the specified resolution. If not specified, `resolution` defaults to the lowest valid resolution.

        :param filter: Narrows down the results to only the response objects that satisfy the filter criteria.
        :type filter: str

        :type ids: List[str]
        :param limit: Limits the size of the response to the specified number of objects on each page. To return the total number of resources, set `limit=0`. The total number of resources is returned as a `total_item_count` value. If the page size requested is larger than the system maximum limit, the server returns the maximum limit, disregarding the requested page size.
        :type limit: int
        :param local_pod_ids: A comma-separated list of local pod IDs. If, after filtering, there is not at least one resource that matches each of the elements, then an error is returned. This cannot be provided together with the `local_pod_names` query parameter.
        :type local_pod_ids: List[str]
        :param local_pod_names: A comma-separated list of local pod names. If, after filtering, there is not at least one resource that matches each of the elements, then an error is returned. This cannot be provided together with the `local_pod_ids` query parameter.

        :type remote_pod_names: List[str]
        :param resolution: The number of milliseconds between samples of historical data. For array-wide performance metrics (`/arrays/performance` endpoint), valid values are `1000` (1 second), `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For performance metrics on storage objects (`<object name>/performance` endpoint), such as volumes, valid values are `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For space metrics, (`<object name>/space` endpoint), valid values are `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). Include the `start_time` parameter to display the performance data starting at the specified start time. If `start_time` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. Include the `end_time` parameter to display the performance data until the specified end time. If `end_time`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. If the `resolution` parameter is not specified but either the `start_time` or `end_time` parameter is, then `resolution` will default to the lowest valid resolution.
        :type resolution: int
        :param sort: Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names as comma-separated values.
        :type sort: List[str]
        :param start_time: Displays historical performance data for the specified time window, where `start_time` is the beginning of the time window, and `end_time` is the end of the time window. The `start_time` and `end_time` parameters are specified in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch. If `start_time` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. If `end_time`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. Include the `resolution` parameter to display the performance data at the specified resolution. If not specified, `resolution` defaults to the lowest valid resolution.
        :type start_time: int
        :param total_item_count: If set to `true`, the `total_item_count` matching the specified query parameters is calculated and returned in the response. If set to `false`, the `total_item_count` is `null` in the response. This may speed up queries where the `total_item_count` is large. If not specified, defaults to `false`.
        :type total_item_count: bool
        :param total_only: If set to `true`, only return the aggregate value of all items after filtering. For real-time performance, the values are aggregated for the latest timestamp. For historical performance, the values are aggregated for each timestamp from `start_time` to `end_time`. Where it makes more sense, the average value is displayed instead. The values are displayed for each name where meaningful. If `total_only=true`, the `items` list will be empty.
        :type total_only: bool

In addition, changing the link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target pod.
