                The security token that represents the identity of the party on
                behalf of whom the request is being made, issued by an enabled
                API client on the array. Overrides given private key.
            private_key_file (str, optional):
                The path of the private key to use. Defaults to None.
            private_key_password (str, optional):

            username (str, optional):
                Username of the user the token should be issued for. This must
                be a valid user in the system.
            client_id (str, optional):
                ID of API client that issued the identity token.
            key_id (str, optional):
                Key ID of API client that issued the identity token.
            issuer (str, optional):
                API client's trusted identity issuer on the array.

                The number of times to retry an API call if it fails for a
                non-blocking reason. Defaults to 5.
            timeout int or (float, float), optional:
                The timeout duration in seconds, either in total time or
                (connect and read) times. Defaults to None.
            ssl_cert (str, optional):
                SSL certificate to use. Defaults to None.

                                system-generated token taken from the `x-next-token` header field of the
                                response. A query has reached its last page when the response does not
                                include a token. Pagination requires the `limit` and `continuation_token`
                                query parameters.

                                multiple host group names and volume names; instead, at least one of the
                                objects (e.g., `host_group_names`) must be set to only one name (e.g.,
                                `hgroup01`).

                        mix of multiple objects with multiple names. For example, a request cannot
                        include a mix of multiple host names and volume names; instead, at least one
                        of the objects (e.g., `host_names`) must be set to only one name (e.g.,
                        `host01`).
        :type host_names: List[str]
        :param limit: Limits the size of the response to the specified number of objects on each page.
                    To return the total number of resources, set `limit=0`. The total number of
                    resources is returned as a `total_item_count` value. If the page size
                    requested is larger than the system maximum limit, the server returns the
                    maximum limit, disregarding the requested page size.
        :type limit: int
        :param offset: The starting position based on the results of the query in relation to the full
                    set of response objects returned.
        :type offset: int
        :param protocol_endpoint_names: Performs the operation on the protocol endpoints specified. Enter multiple names
                                        in comma-separated format. For example, `pe01,pe02`. A request cannot
                                        include a mix of multiple objects with multiple names. For example, a
                                        request cannot include a mix of multiple protocol endpoint names and
                                        host names; instead, at least one of the objects (e.g.,
                                        `protocol_endpoint_names`) must be set to one name (e.g., `pe01`).
        :type protocol_endpoint_names: List[str]
        :param sort: Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `sort` to the name in
                    the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names
                    in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending
                    order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To
                    sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single
                    request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all
                    volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the
                    same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list
                    the names as comma-separated values.
        :type sort: List[str]
        :param total_item_count: If set to `true`, the `total_item_count` matching the specified query parameters
                                is calculated and returned in the response. If set to `false`, the
                                `total_item_count` is `null` in the response. This may speed up queries
                                where the `total_item_count` is large. If not specified, defaults to
                                `false`.
        :type total_item_count: bool
        :param volume_names: Performs the operation on the volume specified. Enter multiple names in comma-
                            separated format. For example, `vol01,vol02`. A request cannot include a
                            mix of multiple objects with multiple names. For example, a request cannot
                            include a mix of multiple volume names and host names; instead, at least
                            one of the objects (e.g., `volume_names`) must be set to only one name

        :param continuation_token: A token used to retrieve the next page of data with some consistency guaranteed.
                                The token is a Base64 encoded value. Set `continuation_token` to the
                                system-generated token taken from the `x-next-token` header field of the
                                response. A query has reached its last page when the response does not
                                include a token. Pagination requires the `limit` and `continuation_token`
                                query parameters.
        :type continuation_token: str
        :param filter: Narrows down the results to only the response objects that satisfy the filter
                    criteria.
        :type filter: str
        :param group_names: Performs the operation on the unique group name specified. Examples of groups
                            include host groups, pods, protection groups, and volume groups. Enter
                            multiple names in comma-separated format. For example, `hgroup01,hgroup02`.
        :type group_names: List[str]
        :param limit: Limits the size of the response to the specified number of objects on each page.
                    To return the total number of resources, set `limit=0`. The total number of
                    resources is returned as a `total_item_count` value. If the page size
                    requested is larger than the system maximum limit, the server returns the
                    maximum limit, disregarding the requested page size.
        :type limit: int
        :param member_names: Performs the operation on the unique member name specified. Examples of members
                            include volumes, hosts, host groups, and directories. Enter multiple names
                            in comma-separated format. For example, `vol01,vol02`.

        :param sort: Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `sort` to the name in
                    the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names
                    in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending
                    order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To
                    sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single
                    request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all
                    volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the
                    same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list
                    the names as comma-separated values.

                                `total_item_count` is `null` in the response. This may speed up queries
                                where the `total_item_count` is large. If not specified, defaults to
                                `false`.

                    request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all
                    volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the
                    same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list

        :param limit: Limits the size of the response to the specified number of objects on each page.
                    To return the total number of resources, set `limit=0`. The total number of

                    order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To

                                include a token. Pagination requires the `limit` and `continuation_token`

        :param limit: Limits the size of the response to the specified number of objects on each page.
                    To return the total number of resources, set `limit=0`. The total number of
                    resources is returned as a `total_item_count` value. If the page size
                    requested is larger than the system maximum limit, the server returns the

                    order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To
                    sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single
                    request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all
                    volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the
                    same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list

        :param limit: Limits the size of the response to the specified number of objects on each page.
                    To return the total number of resources, set `limit=0`. The total number of
                    resources is returned as a `total_item_count` value. If the page size
                    requested is larger than the system maximum limit, the server returns the

                    in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending
                    order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To
                    sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single
                    request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all
                    volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the
                    same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list

                    order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To

                    request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all
                    volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the
                    same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list

                                where the `total_item_count` is large. If not specified, defaults to
