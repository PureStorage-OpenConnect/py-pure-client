        Unstretches a pod from an array, collapsing the pod to a single array. Unstretch a pod from an array when the volumes within the stretched pod no longer need to be synchronously replicated between the two arrays. After a pod has been unstretched, synchronous replication stops. A destroyed version of the pod with \"restretch\" appended to the pod name is created on the array that no longer has the pod. The restretch pod represents a point-in-time snapshot of the pod, just before it was unstretched. The restretch pod enters an eradication pending period starting from the time that the pod was unstretched. A restretch can pod can be cloned or destroyed, but it cannot be explicitly recovered. The `group_names` parameter represents the name of the pod to be unstretched. The `member_names` parameter represents the name of the array from which the pod is to be unstretched. The `group_names` and `member_names` parameters are required and must be set together.

        :type x_request_id: str

Set `continuation_token` to the system-generated token taken from the `x-next-token` header field of the response. A query has reached its last page when the response does not include a token. Pagination requires the `limit` and `continuation_token` query parameters.

Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names as comma-separated values.

        :param resolution: The number of milliseconds between samples of historical data. For array-wide performance metrics (`/arrays/performance` endpoint), valid values are `1000` (1 second), `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For performance metrics on storage objects (`<object name>/performance` endpoint), such as volumes, valid values are `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours).

Include the `start_time` parameter to display the performance data starting at the specified start time. If `start_time` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. Include the `end_time` parameter to display the performance data until the specified end time. If `end_time`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. If the `resolution` parameter is not specified but either the `start_time` or `end_time` parameter is, then `resolution` will default to the lowest valid resolution.

        :param sort: Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names as comma-separated values.
        :type sort: List[str]
        :param start_time: Displays historical performance data for the specified time window, where `start_time` is the beginning of the time window, and `end_time` is the end of the time window. The `start_time` and `end_time` parameters are specified in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch. If `start_time` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. If `end_time`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. Include the `resolution` parameter to display the performance data at the specified resolution. If not specified, `resolution` defaults to the lowest valid resolution.
        :type start_time: int

        :type total_item_count: bool
        :param total_only: If set to `true`, returns the aggregate value of all items after filtering. Where it makes more sense, the average value is displayed instead. The values are displayed for each name where meaningful. If `total_only=true`, the `items` list will be empty.

For performance metrics on storage objects (`<object name>/performance` endpoint), such as volumes, valid values are `30000` (30 seconds), `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). For space metrics, (`<object name>/space` endpoint), valid values are `300000` (5 minutes), `1800000` (30 minutes), `7200000` (2 hours), `28800000` (8 hours), and `86400000` (24 hours). Include the `start_time` parameter to display the performance data starting at the specified start time. If `start_time` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. Include the `end_time` parameter to display the performance data until the specified end time. If `end_time`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. If the `resolution` parameter is not specified but either the `start_time` or `end_time` parameter is, then `resolution` will default to the lowest valid resolution.
        :type resolution: int
        :param sort: Returns the response objects in the order specified. Set `sort` to the name in the response by which to sort. Sorting can be performed on any of the names in the response, and the objects can be sorted in ascending or descending order. By default, the response objects are sorted in ascending order. To sort in descending order, append the minus sign (`-`) to the name. A single request can be sorted on multiple objects. For example, you can sort all volumes from largest to smallest volume size, and then sort volumes of the same size in ascending order by volume name. To sort on multiple names, list the names as comma-separated values.
        :type sort: List[str]
        :param start_time: Displays historical performance data for the specified time window, where `start_time` is the beginning of the time window, and `end_time` is the end of the time window. The `start_time` and `end_time` parameters are specified in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch. If `start_time` is not specified, the start time will default to one resolution before the end time, meaning that the most recent sample of performance data will be displayed. If `end_time`is not specified, the end time will default to the current time. Include the `resolution` parameter to display the performance data at the specified resolution. If not specified, `resolution` defaults to the lowest valid resolution.
        :type start_time: int
        :param total_item_count: If set to `true`, the `total_item_count` matching the specified query parameters is calculated and returned in the response. If set to `false`, the `total_item_count` is `null` in the response. This may speed up queries where the `total_item_count` is large. If not specified, defaults to `false`.
        :type total_item_count: bool
        :param total_only: If set to `true`, returns the aggregate value of all items after filtering. Where it makes more sense, the average value is displayed instead. The values are displayed for each name where meaningful. If `total_only=true`, the `items` list will be empty.
        :type total_only: bool
        :param async_req: Whether to execute the request asynchronously.
        :type async_req: bool, optional
        :param _preload_content: if False, the ApiResponse.data will
                                 be set to none and raw_data will store the
                                 HTTP response body without reading/decoding.
                                 Default is True.
        :type _preload_content: bool, optional
        :param _return_http_data_only: response data instead of ApiResponse
                                       object with status code, headers, etc
        :type _return_http_data_only: bool, optional
        :param _request_timeout: timeout setting for this request. If one
                                 number provided, it will be total request
                                 timeout. It can also be a pair (tuple) of
                                 (connection, read) timeouts.
        :param _request_auth: set to override the auth_settings for an a single
                              request; this effectively ignores the authentication
                              in the spec for a single request.
        :type _request_auth: dict, optional
        :type _content_type: string, optional: force content-type for the request
        :return: Returns the result object.
                 If the method is called asynchronously,
                 returns the request thread.
