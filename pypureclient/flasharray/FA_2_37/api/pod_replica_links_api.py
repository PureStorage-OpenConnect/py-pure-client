        Deletes pod replica links. The `local_pod_names` and `remote_pod_names` are required. Valid values are `replicating`, `baselining`, `paused`, `unhealthy`, `quiescing`, and `quiesced`. A status of `replicating` indicates that the source array is replicating to the target array. A status of `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being sent. During this phase, you cannot promote the target pod. In addition, changing the link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target pod.

        Modifies pod replica links. The `local_pod_names` and `remote_pod_names` are required. Valid values are `replicating`, `baselining`, `paused`, `unhealthy`, `quiescing`, and `quiesced`. A status of `replicating` indicates that the source array is replicating to the target array. A status of `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being sent. During this phase, you cannot promote the target pod. In addition, changing the link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target pod.

        """Create pod replica links

        Creates pod replica links between two arrays. The `local_pod_names` and `remote_pod_names` are required. Valid values are `replicating`, `baselining`, `paused`, `unhealthy`, `quiescing`, and `quiesced`. A status of `replicating` indicates that the source array is replicating to the target array. A status of `baselining` indicates that the the initial version of the dataset is being sent. During this phase, you cannot promote the target pod. In addition, changing the link direction might trigger the `baselining` status to recur. A status of `paused ` indicates that data transfer between objects has stopped. A status of `unhealthy` indicates that the link is currently unhealthy and customers must perform some health checks to determine the cause. A status of `quiescing` indicates that the source pod is not accepting new write requests but the most recent changes to the source have not arrived on the target. A status of `quiesced` indicates that the source pod has been demoted and all changes have been replicated to the target pod.
